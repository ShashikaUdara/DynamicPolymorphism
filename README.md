# DynamicPolymorphism
This is a simple demonstration one of polymorphism mechanism we called Dynamic Polymorphism (Run time polymorphism). Run time Polymorphism happens when you override your code. Overriding means changing derived method from original method.

To compile:

g++ BaseClass.cpp BaseClass.h DerivedClass1.cpp DerivedClass1.h DerivedClass2.cpp DerivedClass2.h DerivedClass3.cpp DerivedClass3.h main.cpp -o dynamicPoly

To Run on Linux: ./dynamicPoly

To Run in Windows dynamicPoly.exe
